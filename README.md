# Unsplash-Api-project
Image Search App

This is a React Js project that shows a searchbar Upon the mounting of the page. User may then enter the name of any image of choice and submit. On submit, the image will be fetched from the Unsplash Api. I used class components. I also used axios to fetch the data and used semantic ui for the search bar design.
